    // TODO(traks): We should also consider lowering the internal receive/send
    // buffer sizes. The client doesn't send us that much data and we pull it
    // out of the receive buffer every tick, so it doesn't need to be very
    // large.
    //
    // Currently there's a problem related to this on macOS actually. If I
    // connect 400 clients to the server with 2 chunk sends per tick per player,
    // the number of mbufs in use in 'netstat -m' increases rapidly to the
    // limit. Once the limit is reached, all networking seems to break. Very
    // confused about this. Why doesn't it fully preallocate the buffers for
    // each client? Is it done so the OS uses less memory?
    //
    // In any case, we should handle these kinds of things properly. If a send
    // fails (with ENOBUFS), don't send any data for a bit and don't kick the
    // client immediately. If the error persists for too long, kick the client.
    // Also don't send chunks if our backlog of chunk sends across all clients
    // is too large.
    //
    // We need better limits of the number of chunk sends anyhow. Compressing
    // chunk packets is VERY slow. Part of this can be resolved by not inserting
    // 2048 byte light sections of full dark/full bright light. However, if
    // we're starting to have a backlog, we should also dynamically adjust the
    // maximum global number of chunk sends per tick. We still need to ensure
    // each client does receive chunks within a certain time frame. Chunk sends
    // shouldn't be limited to the lucky few. Everyone should get their share of
    // chunks. Possibly specially marked players could get priority.
    //
    // Another idea to spend less time on compression is the following. When a
    // chunk is sent, cache the compressed packet for a while. If multiple
    // players need the chunk, we can then reuse the compressed packet. One
    // major issue with this is that the cached packet needs to be invalidated
    // when the chunk changes. Perhaps we could also append some section
    // change/light change packets to the chunk when that happens. Though that
    // doesn't really seem worth it (especially the light changes).
    //
    // I'm thinking the majority of loaded chunks don't change (even in vanilla
    // survival). So caching compressed chunk packets may be quite effective.
    // Though there's little point if players are spread out.
